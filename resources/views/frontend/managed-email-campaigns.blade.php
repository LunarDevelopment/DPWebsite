                    <h1>Managed Email Campaigns</h1>
                    <p><strong>So you’ve sorted your contacts and are ready to get in touch, but how do you do it?
                            Whether you’re an email marketing veteran or just getting started out, the marketing team at
                            Digital Picnic are ready to get your campaigns underway.
                        </strong></p>
                    <p>We’ve worked with a number of brands across a range of industries, so we understand there is no
                        ‘one size fits all’ approach. We’ll spend time to develop a tailor made strategy specifically
                        for your brand, covering everything from subject lines to design – that works for your customers
                        and gets you results.</p>
                    <p>We’ll set up a private email sending domain – with an email address that matches your website URL
                        for use on your email campaigns alone meaning you have full control over your own sending
                        reputation.</p>
                    <p>Then, to help you maximize your ROI we’ll provide you with Live Lead Alerts within 15 minutes of
                        a recipient clicking on a web link and visiting your website! (That’s over 95 times quicker than
                        other analytics!) Not only this but we’ll also provide a full report giving you access to the
                        data records of those who’ve shown interest in your email either by opening or clicking on a web
                        link. The report allows you to see a breakdown of who opened, who clicked through, and what they
                        clicked on – giving you insight into what the recipient is interested in, making it easier for
                        you to follow up that lead and generate some business.</p>

                    <p>We've been using Digital Picnic to manage our email marketing for over a year now - the campaigns
                        have made it so much easier for us to identify businesses looking to purchase compared to
                        trawling through a big list of data, and our Account Manager Danielle is always extremely
                        helpful when we're looking to find a new target audience!
