                    <p><strong>Email marketing has an average ROI of £38 for every £1 spent, and you're average order
                            value is likely to be 3x higher compared to leads from social media... But what if facts and
                            figures aren't enough? Still not sure email marketing is for you?</strong></p>
                    <p>Sample the Picnic with our Cost Per Engagement (CPE) campaigns. They do as they say, in which
                        after a small set up fee, you'll only have to pay for the engagement the campaign generates for
                        your brand. So if we don't perform, you don't pay!</p>
                    <p>Our team will work closely with you on everything from the design to the domain you're sending
                        from, ensuring your email strategy is effective and sustainable for you as a business.</p>
