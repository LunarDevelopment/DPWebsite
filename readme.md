Please see below... I've italicised what needs to be done before customers see a version of it - the rest we can live with until version 1.2... :-) Thanks & sorry!!!

##Homepage
- ~~Cookies keep popping back up & it doesn't have a link to read more - should link to both the cookie policy & meet the team pages (in the Homepage mockup).~~ "Reduced text-size as deemed unneccessary by Lewis"
- ~~_Where do subscribers go? I've received an email when I fill in the contact us page but not when I subscribe._~~
- ~~Mobile responsive logo to have space around logo~~
- ~~Little bit of space between the top 'Subscribe to our mailing list' and the button. Maybe 20px - 30px~~
- ~~The space used between the 'Subscribe (and the button)' are to be the same as 'Social' header and the icons. Add same spacing used for the social part.~~
- Icons come from one side of the page in each section rather than from both sides
- Remove additional white space on each section on home page (or reduce it once the basket hits the bottom)
- ~~Link DMA logo with specific page on DMA website (http://dma.org.uk/company/digital-picnic)~~
- ~~Home page and Product drop down menu are in different orders - need to be the same please (Data, Managed Email Campaigns, Design, CPE)~~
 
 
##Footer
- ~~Postcode needs capitalised~~
- ~~Address should read Newcastle Upon Tyne, not just Newcastle (same on contact us page)~~
- ~~List of pages needs capitals - Home, About Us, Contact Us etc~~
- ~~_Site map link goes nowhere..._~~ "Postponed as sitemap not necessary site map link removed"
- ~~Grass appears to be 2 different shades of green? Does it?~~
- ~~Can the social media icons open a new page please? Rather than take someone away from our website.~~ 
- ~~Can the info@ be a mailto please?~~
 
 
##About Us
- ~~Icons aren't in order, should be as follows: Data, Managed Email Campaigns, Design, CPE~~
 
##Meet the team
- _Can we have alphabetical order by surname_
- ~~_Everybody needs a surname_~~
- ~~Pete disappears when you click 'All' at the top~~
- ~~_Shouldn't show LinkedIn URL - should say "Connect with me on LinkedIn"_~~
- ~~_Loses peoples name and cuts 1/4 of circle off when responsive (larger than iPhone version)._~~
- ~~Have 'Graphic Designer' instead of 'Graphic Design'~~
 
 
##Product Pages
- Quotes in coloured boxed should have large quotation marks around them as in the mock up
- Overview product page shows the same info for the Design section and Managed Email Campaigns. 
- ~~Managed Email Campaigns should read: So youâ€™ve sorted your contacts and are ready to get in touch, but how do you do it? Whether you're an email marketing veteran or...~~
 
##Other
- Privacy page has weird spacing eg below the Data Protection Act para and above bullets relating to it
